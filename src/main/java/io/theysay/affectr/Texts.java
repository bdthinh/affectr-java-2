        "Last Friday, buried in a Motorola forum, the company quietly abandoned its update pledge, killing off plans to ever update the Photon 4G. \n" +

        "Michael Adebowale, 22, was separately arrested on suspicion of the attempted murder of a police officer. \n" +

        "Mr Adebowale will be interviewed by the Met Counter Terrorism Command, Scotland Yard said. \n" +
        "'Shame and distress' \n" +
        "The Metropolitan Police said earlier that the men would not be questioned until they had been discharged from hospital, and the time they had spent under arrest so far would not count towards the maximum amount of time they could legally be held without charge. \n" +
        "Both men are Britons of Nigerian descent who are understood to be converts to Islam. \n" +

        "Relatives of Mr Adebolajo issued a statement of condolence to Drummer Rigby's family on Tuesday, saying: \"As a family, we wish to share with others our horror at the senseless killing of Lee Rigby and express our profound shame and distress that this has brought our family.\" \n" +
        "They continued: \"We wish to state openly that we believe that there is no place for violence in the name of religion or politics. \n" +

        "Meanwhile, it has emerged that Mr Adebojalo complained to a human rights group last year that he and his family were being \"harassed\" by British security services in order to get their help. \n" +
        "Mr Adebojalo was arrested in Kenya in 2010 where he was believed to have been preparing to fight with Somali militant group al-Shabab. He was later deported. \n" +
        "Abu Nusaybah - a childhood friend - told BBC Newsnight on Friday that following the arrest, MI5 contacted Mr Adebojalo to ask him to work for them, but he rejected the approach. \n" +
        "And now Cageprisoners, which describes itself as representing those who believe they have been wrongly imprisoned in the war on terror, said it had interviewed Mr Adebolajo and his relatives in April 2012. \n" +
        "The organisation said he and his family told them they had received numerous phone calls, text messages and visits from British security agents pressuring them to co-operate. \n" +
        "According to notes from an interview conducted by the group with Mr Adebolajo's sister, she told them that \"because of the harassment, her brother is now forced to live in a state of secrecy, cannot be contacted over the phone\". \n" +
